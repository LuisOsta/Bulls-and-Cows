How to Play:
 DIFFICULTY:
    On launch the program will prompt you for the difficulty level, 0 to 4 where 0 is the hardest and 4 is the easiest.
    Note this only affects the number of guess you have ; the higher the difficulty the lower the number of guesses.
    Once the difficulty is selected the timer will start and the game will begin.
    
  RULES:
    In the game you are supposed to guesses a four letter word. The four letter word will only contain english alphabetical
    characters. Where each character is unique, meaning that no character is repeated/used more than once. The game will end
    once you use all your guess, you get the word right or you quit the game by typing "quit". For testing purposes the four
    letter word will displayed at the start of the game.
 
  COWS & BULLS:
    After every guess you will be shown the number of cows and bulls you got. You get BULL for each character that is matching
    and in the correct postion. If it is in the wrong position then you get a COW. For example if the word is "base" then the
    guess "beat" will have 2 COW and 1 BULL (the COWS are 'a' and 'e' the BULL is 'b')
    
 
  WINNING/LOSING:
    To win you have guess the word in X amount of guesses or less (X is based on the difficulty). To lose you have to use all
    the guesses without guess the word correctly. If you lose a sound will play and the program will end. IF you win a difference
    sound will play, you will be told the amount of time it took in seconds and the program will end.
